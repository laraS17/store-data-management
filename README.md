# store-data-management
Optimization of store data management by analyzing product and sales data using Python.

## Project Overview

This project involves optimizing the management of data for *BottleNeck*, a high-end wine retailer. The goal is to merge and analyze product data from the company's ERP system and online store to gain insights into sales performance, identify potential pricing errors, and calculate revenue.

The project includes:
1. Merging product data from two sources: the ERP system and the online store.
2. Calculating the revenue per product and total revenue generated online.
3. Performing a univariate analysis to detect potential pricing errors and presenting these findings visually.

## Deliverables

1. **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)**: The Python notebook that merges the datasets, performs the analysis, and visualizes the results.
2. **Presentation (PPT)**: A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the results, including insights into sales, revenue, and potential data inconsistencies.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/laraS17/store-data-management.git
